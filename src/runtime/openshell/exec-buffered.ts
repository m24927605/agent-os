/**
 * SLICE-EXEC2 — `makeOpenShellExecCapable`: the THIN buffered wrapper that reconciles OpenShell's
 * existing STREAMING exec onto the substrate port's BUFFERED `ExecCapableSandboxAdapter` contract, so
 * the credential-blind `makeExecEffect` can drive a REAL OpenShell sandbox.
 *
 * The OpenShell adapter ALREADY owns the hard parts (it is NOT touched here): `execSandbox(...cmd, opts)`
 * drives the `ExecSandbox` server-stream, accumulates stdout/stderr, converges on the terminal exit, and
 * is already FAIL-CLOSED + capped — an 8 MiB byte-cap overflow DENIES (never OOM, never a truncated
 * success), a wall-clock deadline that elapses before a terminal exit DENIES (never a fabricated exit 0),
 * and an over-8-MiB `stdin` payload DENIES at `ExecOptsSchema` (SLICE-CAP1). This wrapper is a pure SHAPE
 * adapter; it adds NO new fail-closed logic and removes none — it only forwards the port spec's fields
 * (env / timeoutMs / stdin) into the OpenShell opts the adapter already validates and forwards.
 *
 * The reconcile is two collisions:
 *   1. SHAPE — OpenShell exposes a `{status:"ok"|"denied"}` union (`OsExecOutcome`) carrying its OWN
 *      richer `ExecResult` (`Uint8Array` stdout/stderr); the port wants a `{ok:true|false}` union
 *      (`port.ExecResult`) carrying `string` stdout/stderr + a `truncated` flag.
 *   2. NAME — both unions name a type `ExecResult`. The OpenShell one is imported under an alias
 *      (`OsExecResult`) so the two never silently conflate.
 *
 * Mapping (the ONLY safety-relevant logic):
 *   • status "ok"     -> { ok:true, exitCode, stdout: decode(streams.stdout), stderr: decode, truncated:false }
 *   • status "denied" -> { ok:false, reason }   — a denied/failed outcome is NEVER mapped to ok and a
 *                                                 fabricated exit 0 is NEVER invented (byte-cap / deadline
 *                                                 deny propagate as { ok:false } verbatim).
 * `truncated` is always `false`: the OpenShell adapter NEVER returns a truncated SUCCESS — an overflow is
 * a deny, not a capped ok — so a buffered ok is always the full captured output. The port-level 64KB cap
 * lives in `makeExecEffect` (applied AFTER redaction), not here.
 *
 * Lifecycle (create/start/stop/destroy) is DELEGATED verbatim to the wrapped adapter, so the SAME
 * `refById` mapping backs both lifecycle and exec on one adapter instance.
 *
 * This file lives in the OpenShell vendor zone (`src/runtime/openshell/`) and reaches the substrate port
 * types ONLY through the substrate barrel (`../substrate/index.js`) — `no-vendor-in-core` and
 * `not-to-internal` both hold (a vendor adapter consuming a port barrel is exactly the allowed edge).
